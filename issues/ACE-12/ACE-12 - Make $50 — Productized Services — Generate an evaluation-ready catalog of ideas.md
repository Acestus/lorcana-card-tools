## Actions

### 2026-05-30 00:50

- WORKLOG 45m: Explored ~/git (25+ repos) and ~/github (portfolio, website, workflow-toolkit) to inventory skills and production work. Generated 53 productized service and business ideas across 10 categories.
- COMMENT: Did a full sweep of the work portfolio — 25+ Bicep stacks in iac-infra, Fabric ETL in loanetl/fabric-edm, the Five9 call script connector, fabric-scheduler, workflow-toolkit, the portfolio site (21 SPAs in ClojureScript + Rust/WASM), the Clojure blog/resume site, networking IaC, and various POCs. Mapped these to 53 concrete business ideas organized in 10 categories: Platform Engineering as a Service, Data Platform Products, AI Ops & Developer Productivity, Contact Center Integration, Web & Portfolio Products, Identity & Security, Content & Education, Niche SaaS, Fractional/Retainer Services, and Compound Products. Ready to publish to Notion for prioritization.

### 2026-06-01 13:24

- WORKLOG 10m: Confirmed the catalog is sufficient as internal documentation and closed the ticket after the user accepted the existing Notion-backed page as enough.
- COMMENT: Confirmed this is internal documentation, not a public-facing offer page. The catalog is already sufficient as a Notion-backed reference, and the next step is to work the ideas one ticket at a time rather than keep expanding this file. No additional catalog work is needed for this ticket.

## Follow-up

Status: Done
TODO:
- [x] Publish the ideas list to Notion as a long-form page
- [x] Score/prioritize top 10 ideas by effort vs. revenue potential
- [x] Pick 2-3 to prototype or package first
